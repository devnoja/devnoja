## Hello World :wave:
My name is Noel Jackson. I'm a software developer from Dar-es-salaam, Tanzania. I build websites and web apps that are delightful and informative and I'm proud to say I do it really well.\
Iâ€™m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction.
I do my best to level up my skill sets so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand.
